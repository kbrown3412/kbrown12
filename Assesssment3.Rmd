# Our objective function is: min: 12 y1 + 14 y2 + 16 y3 + 18 y4 + 2 a1 + 2 a2 + 2 a3 + 2 a4 + 10 x1 + 12 x2 + 14 x3 + 16 x4;
#We have to decide how many units of raw material to buy each month with the given information. In the objective function, y: 1,  2,3, and 4 represent the number of units to be purchased in each month (at the designated cost per month up to 200 units), a: 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent the number of units which will be stored each month, and x: 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent the number of units purchased in their repsective month excess of 200. 
# Our constraints are: 0 <= y1 <= 200;  0 <= y2 <= 200;  0 <= y3 <= 200;          0 <= y4 <= 200;  y1 + x1 - a1 = 150;  a1 + y2 + x2 - a2 = 200;                   a2 + y3 + x3 - a3 = 250;  a3 + y4 + x4 - a4 = 150;  y1 - 200 b1 >= 0;            y2 - 200 b2 >= 0;  y3 - 200 b3 >= 0;  y4 - 200 b4 >= 0;  x1 - 50000 b1 <= 0;     x2 - 50000 b2 <= 0;  x3 - 50000 b3 <= 0;  x4 - 50000 b4 <= 0;                    int b1, b2, b3, b4;
#The first set of constraints limits the amount of units purchased at intial monthyl price to 200 per month. The next set state that amount purchased each month (whether at original or discounted price), added to the amount stored from last month, and then subtract the amount to be stored in the current month will equal the demand. The next two set of constraints are binary constraints which force the variables to be active only when the y's are greater than 200 and x's are less than 50,000. 
#In regards to sensitivity analysis, the model states this is the optimal solution.
